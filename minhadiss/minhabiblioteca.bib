Teoreettisten ja vastaavien kokeellisten vaikutusalojen eroavaisuudet on kvantifioitu K-kertoimien avulla.

	url = {https://jyx.jyu.fi/handle/123456789/86916},
	abstract = {This thesis investigates the possibility of describing coherent exclusive photoproduction 
of heavy-vector mesons in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions (UPCs) by 
using inclusive collinearly factorizable parton distribution functions (PDFs). The 
aim is to chart the scale dependence and the PDF-originated uncertainties of such 
photoproduction cross sections, arising in the approximation where the generalized 
parton distributions (GPDs) are simply approximated by their forward limit counter 
parts, i.e., the PDFs. The introductory part presents the PDFs and GPDs in their 
physics contexts, their connection to each other and to the nuclear ones, shows the 
full leading order (LO) calculation of the photoproduction amplitude in perturbative 
quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) and describes the way the quark contribution 
arises at next-to-leading order (NLO). Furthermore, details of the required modeling 
of the form factors and photon fluxes are described before finally collecting everything 
together for the nucleus-nucleus UPCs. 
The described framework is the basis on which most of the results of the 
papers [PI, PII, PIII] rely. Article [PI] was the very first NLO pQCD study of rapidity 
differential cross sections of coherent exclusive photoproduction of \textit{J}/\textit{ψ} mesons in 
lead-lead UPCs. Article [PII] extended the results to the case of oxygen-oxygen 
collisions and studied the possibility of constraining the strong scale dependence 
of the results of article [PI] through suitably chosen ratios of cross sections. Then 
finally in article [PIII] the framework was extended to the case of U mesons with the 
addition of the skewing correction through the Shuvaev transform. 
The results show the importance of the ERBL region for a strongly growing 
gluon PDF but other than that no tight constraints for the gluons were found. 
Surprisingly, sensitivity to the quark PDFs was discovered in the \textit{J}/\textit{ψ} case, due 
to which the studied process may be a probe of the elusive strangeness content of 
bound nucleons. The sensitivity originates from the cancelling nature of the LO and 
NLO gluon contributions in the scattering amplitude. This thesis paves the way 
towards including the studied exclusive processes as constraints in the global analysis 
of PDFs and their nuclear counterparts.

	abstract = {The generalized parton distributions, introduced nearly a decade ago, have emerged as a universal tool to describe hadrons in terms of quark and gluonic degrees of freedom. They combine the features of form factors, parton densities and distribution amplitudes--the functions used for a long time in studies of hadronic structure. Generalized parton distributions are analogous to the phase-space Wigner quasi-probability function of non-relativistic quantum mechanics which encodes full information on a quantum-mechanical system. We give an extensive review of main achievements in the development of this formalism. We discuss physical interpretation and basic properties of generalized parton distributions, their modeling and QCD evolution in the leading and next-to-leading orders. We describe how these functions enter a wide class of exclusive reactions, such as electro- and photo-production of photons, lepton pairs, or mesons. The theory of these processes requires and implies full control over diverse corrections and thus we outline the progress in handling higher-order and higher-twist effects. We catalogue corresponding results and present diverse techniques for their derivations. Subsequently, we address observables that are sensitive to different characteristics of the nucleon structure in terms of generalized parton distributions. The ultimate goal of the GPD approach is to provide a three-dimensional spatial picture of the nucleon, direct measurement of the quark orbital angular momentum, and various inter- and multi-parton correlations.},

In comparison to our previous analysis, EPS09, where data only from charged-lepton–nucleus deep inelastic scattering (DIS), Drell–Yan (DY) dilepton production in proton–nucleus collisions and inclusive pion production in deuteron–nucleus collisions were the input, we now increase the variety of data constraints to cover also neutrino–nucleus DIS and low-mass DY production in pion–nucleus collisions. The new LHC data significantly extend the kinematic reach of the data constraints. We now allow much more freedom for the flavor dependence of nuclear effects than in other currently available analyses. As a result, especially the uncertainty estimates are more objective flavor by flavor. The neutrino DIS plays a pivotal role in obtaining a mutually consistent behavior for both up and down valence quarks, and the LHC dijet data clearly constrain gluons at large momentum fraction. Mainly for insufficient statistics, the pion–nucleus DY and heavy-gauge-boson production in proton–lead collisions impose less visible constraints. The outcome – a new set of next-to-leading order nuclear PDFs called EPPS16 – is made available for applications in high-energy nuclear collisions.},

	abstract = {The Fortran LHAPDF library has been a long-term workhorse in particle physics, providing standardised access to parton density functions for experimental and phenomenological purposes alike, following on from the venerable PDFLIB package. During Run 1 of the LHC, however, several fundamental limitations in LHAPDF’s design have became deeply problematic, restricting the usability of the library for important physics-study procedures and providing dangerous avenues by which to silently obtain incorrect results. In this paper we present the LHAPDF 6 library, a ground-up re-engineering of the PDFLIB/LHAPDF paradigm for PDF access which removes all limits on use of concurrent PDF sets, massively reduces static memory requirements, offers improved CPU performance, and fixes fundamental bugs in multi-set access to PDF metadata. The new design, restricted for now to interpolated PDFs, uses centralised numerical routines and a powerful cascading metadata system to decouple software releases from provision of new PDF data and allow completely general parton content. More than 200 PDF sets have been migrated from LHAPDF 5 to the new universal data format, via a stringent quality control procedure. LHAPDF 6 is supported by many Monte Carlo generators and other physics programs, in some cases via a full set of compatibility routines, and is recommended for the demanding PDF access needs of LHC Run 2 and beyond.},

Utilizando o método de Weizsäcker-Williams, a seção de choque hadrônica e descrita em função de duas componentes: o uxo de fotons e a seção de choque de fotoprodução. O primeiro descreve a radiação eletromagnética emitida por um dos hadrons em colisão, enquanto o segundo caracteriza a interação da radiação (fótons) com o alvo hadrônico. Em nossos calculos, descrevemos a seção de choque de fotoprodução a partir do formalismo de dipolos de cor, no qual j a estão includos efeitos de supressão como o fenômeno de saturação partônica. No formalismo em questão, o fotonutua em um par quark-antiquark que, por sua vez, interage com o alvo e, por m, se recombina para formar o meson. Para descrever a interação do dipolo com o alvo, modelos de dipolo baseados na equação BK, a qual governa a dinâmica de evolução do dipolo, são utilizados. No regime UPC, calculamos a distribuição em rapidez e a seção de choque total dos m esons citados em colisões pp, p-Pb e Pb-Pb. Para pp e p-Pb, os modelos de dipolo CGC e BCGC apresentam melhor concordância com os dados de LHC.  Por outro lado, os resultados para colis{\textasciitilde}oes Pb-Pb superestimam os dados (somente para J= at e o momento), nos levando a concluir que o formalismo de dipolos não est a considerando todo o efeito de supressão. No regime periferal, as colaborações ALICE e STAR observaram um grande excesso na produção de J= para pequeno pT . Visto que a fotoprodução exclusiva atua nesta região cinematica, n os estendemos o formalismo de dipolos usado em UPC atrav es da construção de três cenarios baseados na geometria da colisão: (cenario 1) aplicação direta do uxo de fotons usual, com dependencia no parametro de impacto, e da seção de choque fotonuclear UPC sem qualquer outra modicação relevante; (cenario 2) aplicação de um uxo de fotons efetivo, construdo em função do uxo de fotons usual, e da seção de choque fotonuclear UPC; (cenario 3) alem do uxo de fotons efetivo, tambem foi considerada uma seção de choque fotonuclear efetiva. Os resultados obtidos com os três diferentes cenarios foram comparados com as medidas de ALICE, mostrando melhor acordo com os dados no cenario 3, principalmente nas regiões mais centrais (30\%-50\% and 50\%-70\%). Embora não seja possível armar que a fotoprodução exclusiva e a unica responsável pelo excesso de J= observado nos experimentos, existem indicações de que este mecanismo de produção e respons avel por uma significativa parte deste efeito.},

In order to evaluate the robustness of the light-cone color dipole formalism, previously tested in the ultraperipheral regime. It was calculated the rapidity distribution as well as the nuclear modification factor (\$R\_\{AA\}\$) for the three centrality classes: 30\%-50\%, 50\%-70\% and 70\%-90\%. The transition from ultraperipheral to peripheral regime was carried out sophisticating the photon flux description and the photonuclear cross section, taking into account the effective interaction area. In our calculations, three scenarios were considered: (scenario 1) the direct application of the usual photon flux and of the photonuclear cross section without any relevant change in relation to the UPC's, (scenario 2) the application of an effective photon flux keeping the photonuclear cross section unchanged and (scenario 3) where it was also considered an effective photonuclear cross section. The results obtained from the three scenarios were compared with the ALICE measurements (only \$J/{\textbackslash}psi\$ at the moment), showing a better agreement with the data in the more complete approach (scenario 3), mainly in the more central regions (30\%-50\% and 50\%-70\%) where the incertainty is smaller.},

	abstract = {In this work, the exclusive photoproduction for the heavy vector mesons V (J/ψ, ψ(2S), Y (1S), Y (2S), Y (3S)) is investigated in peripheral and ultrapheriferal collisons at LHC energies. Using the Weizsa¨cker-Williams method, the hadronic cross section was written in function of two components: the photon ﬂux and the photoproduction cross section. The photon ﬂux describes the eletromagnetic radiation emitted for one of the incomming hadrons, while the photoproduction cross section characterizes the scattering of radiation (photons) on the hadronic target. In our calculations, the photoproduction cross section is described by colour dipole formalism, in which are already present suppression eﬀects like the partonic saturation phenomenon. In this formalism, the incoming virtual photon ﬂuctuates into a quark-antiquark pair, then the qq¯ pair scatters elastically into the proton, and ﬁnally the qq¯ pair recombines to form the meson. To describe the dipole-target interaction, dipole models based in the BK equation, which governs the dynamics of dipole evolution, was used. In the UPC regime, the rapidity distribution and the total cross section was calculated for the V mesons in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions. For pp and p-Pb, the dipole models CGC and bCGC presented better aggrement with the LHC data. Therefore, the results for Pb-Pb collisions overestimate the data (only for J/ψ so far) in the large rapidity range, possibly meaning that the dipole formalism is not considering all the suppresion eﬀects. In the peripheral regime, the ALICE and STAR collaborations observed an excess for J/ψ production at very small pT . Since exclusive photoproduction operates in this kinematic region, the dipole formalism used in UPC was extended to peripheral regime considering three scenarios based in the geometry of the collision: (scenario 1) the direct application of the usual photon ﬂux with b dependence and of the photonuclear cross section with no relevant change in relation to the UPC, (scenario 2) the application of an eﬀective photon ﬂux keeping the photonuclear cross section unchanged, and (scenario 3) also considering an eﬀective photonuclear cross section. The results obtained with the three diﬀerent scenarios were compared with the ALICE measurements, showing a better agreement with the data in the more complete approach (scenario 3), mainly in the more central regions (30\%-50\% and 50\%-70\%). Although it is not yet possible to conﬁrm that the exclusive photoproduction is fully responsible for the J/ψ excess observed in ALICE, however there are good indications that it produces a considerable part of the eﬀect.},

	abstract = {The analysis of light vector meson production by a high-energy electron or photon beam in a particle accelerator provides insight into the composition of the proton, further expanding the fundamental understanding of physics. The electro-production of light vector mesons oﬀ of protons happens when a high virtuality photon interacts with a quark, which can be studied to extract the Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs). These functions provide access to the correlation between the longitudinal momenta of partons and their transverse position. They can be further interpreted to obtain multidimensional images of the proton. Vector mesons are particularly sensitive to the GPDs H and E and allow for ﬂavor decomposition of the proton’s GPDs. We implemented the rho vector meson ρ0 in a generator used in simulations for Jeﬀerson Laboratory (DEEPGen) and for EIC (DEEPSim). Our goal is to contribute to the development of future Hard Exclusive (light) Vector Meson experiments for Jeﬀerson Laboratory and EIC. We will discuss the physical interest of measuring light vector mesons for accessing GPDs, then present our work with the event generator and our projections for future experiments.},

These emerge from the complex dynamics of its fundamental constituents, quarks and gluons, described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Using electron scattering, its electric charge and spin, shared among the quark constituents, have been the topic of active investigation. An example is the novel precision measurement of the proton's electric charge radius. In contrast, little is known about the proton's inner mass density, dominated by the energy carried by the gluons, which are hard to access through electron scattering since gluons carry no electromagnetic charge. Here, we chose to probe this gluonic gravitational density using a small color dipole, the \$J/{\textbackslash}psi\$ particle, through its threshold photoproduction. From our data, we determined, for the first time, the proton's gluonic gravitational form factors. We used a variety of models and determined, in all cases, a mass radius that is notably smaller than the electric charge radius. In some cases, the determined radius, although model dependent, is in excellent agreement with first-principle predictions from lattice QCD. This work paves the way for a deeper understanding of the salient role of gluons in providing gravitational mass to visible matter.},

	abstract = {With the advent of very powerful particle accelerators, such as RHIC and the LHC, it becomes possible to study QCD in high energy collisions, in which the gluon content of the proton or nucleus is probed and its density becomes often large enough for nonlinear effects to play a role. This small-x regime of QCD is well described by an effective theory known as the Color Glass Condensate (CGC). In this thesis, we introduce the CGC and apply it to two different problems. First, we use the CGC to study forward heavy-quark production in pA collisions. When the quarks are nearly back-to-back, the CGC result coincides with the one in the TMD factorization approach. This allows us to extract the small-x limit of the Weizs{\textbackslash}"acker-Williams gluon distribution, as well as the dipole distribution and one extra gluon TMD. Each of these gluon TMDs is accompanied by a partner, which couples via the quark mass and which describes the linearly polarized gluon content of the unpolarized nucleus. We calculate the six resulting gluon TMDs analytically in the MV model, and evolve them in rapidity using a numerical implementation of JIMWLK. The second problem is situated within heavy-ion physics. Jets, produced in the scattering of two nuclei, travel through the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) before reaching the detector, and are attenuated as a result of their interaction with this medium. This phenomenon, known as jet quenching, is one of the main probes to investigate the QGP. We focus on the transverse momentum broadening of a hard particle traveling through a nuclear medium, and employ small-x techniques to attempt to resum the leading logarithmic corrections due to soft gluon radiation. Although, ultimately, we can only solve the resulting in-medium evolution equation to DLA accuracy, we do present a concise framework for the problem, and draw a detailed comparison with the CGC and with the literature.},
